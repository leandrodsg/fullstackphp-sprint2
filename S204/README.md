# Sprint 2 – S204: MongoDB – Queries with `restaurants.json`

This project contains the solution for the **32 exercises** using the MongoDB database and the `restaurants.json` file.

---

## Description

The goal of this activity was to practice writing queries in a MongoDB collection using basic and intermediate operators such as:

- Filtering by value and comparison (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$ne`)
- Regular expressions (`$regex`)
- Limits and sorting (`limit()`, `sort()`)
- Existence and type checks (`$exists`, `$type`)
- Modifiers (`$mod`, `$in`, `$nin`)
- Access to arrays and nested objects

## Files

- `restaurants.json`: dataset used to populate the MongoDB collection
- `queries.js`: JavaScript file with all 32 queries, organized and commented
